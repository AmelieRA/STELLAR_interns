## To get this repo: 
1. Open a Terminal Window, use the 'cd' command to navigate to where you will create a folder for our project work.
2. Once in your desired location type 'mkdir foldername', on the next line use 'cd' to enter this folder.
3. Type 'git init' and press enter.
4. On this webpage look for the green button that says Clone or Download, click that and copy the https:... address.
5. Back in your terminal window type 'git clone thecopiedhttpsaddress'.
6. Now to check clone happened correctly, in terminal type 'git status'. This should say you have no commits yet.
7. Again in terminal type 'git pull' and this will give you access to my notebook and files. 
...Any problems - just ask!
