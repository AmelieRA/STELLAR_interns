## To get this repo: 
#### Open a Terminal Window, use the 'cd' command to navigate to where you will create a folder for our project work.
#### Once in your desired location type 'mkdir foldername', on the next line use 'cd' to enter this folder.
#### Type 'git init' and press enter.
#### On this webpage look for the green button that says Clone or Download, click that and copy the https:... address.
#### Back in your terminal window type 'git clone thecopiedhttpsaddress'.
#### Now to check clone happened correctly, in terminal type 'git status'. This should say you have no commits yet.
#### Again in terminal type 'git pull' and this will give you access to my notebook and files. Any problems - just ask!
