# For Loop Group Activity


## Directions:
1. Switch typer every 10 minutes!
2. Write an iterating loop to open/dl each target's light curve files
3. Open these files inside the loop and don't forget to make them light curve objects (not files)
4. Plot each light curve per sector
5. Make sure you can track which light curve belongs to which target
6. Can you also make the loop print the target id or sector the data comes from?
7. Be prepared to present how you did this in code!
