# For Loop Group Activity


## Directions:
1. Switch typer every 10 minutes!
2. Write a iterating loop to open each target's light curve per sector
3. Plot each light curve per sector
4. Make sure you can track which light curve belongs to which target
5. Can you also make the loop print the target id or sector the data comes from?
